# Dependency Checker

Scuffed dependabot, but for gitlab

## Pre-requisites

- `scala` [https://www.scala-lang.org/download/]


## Usage

1. Rename `registry.example.json` to `registry.json` and fill in your gitlab token
2. Run with `sbt run` (or package it first so that you don't have to recompile every time, you know the drill...)
3. The results will be in the same directory in `export.xlsx` file
